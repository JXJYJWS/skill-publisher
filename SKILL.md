   ↓
2. Download skill ZIPs from SkillBoss
   ↓
3. Extract and prepare files
   ↓
4. Auto-create GitHub repos via API
   ↓
5. Push to GitHub
   ↓
6. Publish to ClawHub
   ↓
7. Update Notion tracker (optional)
```

**Zero manual steps with Option B!**

## Prerequisites

### GitHub Account
1. Username
2. Personal Access Token
   - Generate at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - **Required Permissions**:
     - ✅ `repo` (full repository access)
     - ✅ `admin:repo_hook` (for auto-creation)
   - Format: `ghp_xxxxx...`
   
**Note**: Auto-create feature requires GitHub API access. Token must have permissions to create repos under your account.

### ClawHub Account
1. ClawHub Token
   - Generate at: https://clawhub.ai/settings/tokens
   - Format: `clh_xxxxx...`

### Notion (Optional)
1. Integration Token
   - Generate at: https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
   - Format: `ntn_xxxxx...`
2. Database ID (or parent page ID)

## Usage

### Method 1: From ZIP Files (Manual Repo Creation)

```markdown
I want to publish 5 skills to GitHub and ClawHub.

**GitHub Account**:
- Username: YourUsername
- Token: ghp_xxxxx...

**ClawHub Account**:
- Token: clh_xxxxx...

**Skills**: [send ZIP files]
```

Assistant will:
1. Extract and prepare skills
2. Tell you which GitHub repos to create
3. Push to GitHub (once you confirm repos are created)
4. Publish to ClawHub
5. Provide all links

### Method 2: From SkillBoss.co (Fully Automated) 🆕

```markdown
Auto-publish skills from SkillBoss.co.

**GitHub**:
- Username: YourUsername
- Token: ghp_xxxxx... (must have 'repo' permission)

**ClawHub**:
- Token: clh_xxxxx...

**SkillBoss URLs**:
- https://skillboss.co/skills/ai-helper
- https://skillboss.co/skills/code-reviewer
- https://skillboss.co/skills/data-analyzer

OR just say: "Get top 5 skills from SkillBoss.co"
```

Assistant will:
1. ✅ Scrape skill pages from skillboss.co
2. ✅ Download skill ZIPs (if available)
3. ✅ Auto-create GitHub repos via GitHub API
4. ✅ Push to GitHub
5. ✅ Publish to ClawHub
6. ✅ Provide all links

**Zero manual steps!**

### With Notion Tracking

```markdown
Publish skills and track in Notion.

**Notion Token**: ntn_xxxxx...
**Notion Database**: https://www.notion.so/xxxxx... (or database ID)

[rest same as basic usage]
```

Assistant will also update Notion with:
- Skill Name
- GitHub Account
- GitHub Link
- ClawHub Link
- Stars (initial: 0)

### Multi-Batch Publishing

For multiple GitHub accounts (to avoid spam detection):

**Day 1**:
```markdown
Publish batch 1 with Account A
```

**Day 2** (different account):
```markdown
Publish batch 2 with Account B
```

⚠️ **Rate Limiting**: GitHub may flag frequent account switching. Recommended:
- Max 2 accounts per day
- Space out by several hours
- Or use different IPs (VPN/proxy)

## Scripts

### scrape-skillboss.py (Playwright Auto-Discovery)

**Purpose**: Automatically discover all skills on SkillBoss.co

**Requirements**:
- Python 3.7+
- Playwright: `pip install playwright && playwright install chromium`

**Usage**:
```bash
cd skills/skill-publisher/scripts
python3 scrape-skillboss.py
```

**Output**:
- `/tmp/skillboss-all-skills.txt` - List of discovered skill IDs
- `/tmp/skillboss-skills-page.png` - Screenshot for debugging

**How it works**:
1. Launches headless Chromium browser
2. Visits `https://www.skillboss.co/skills`
3. Scrolls page multiple times to load content
4. Extracts all `/skills/{id}` URLs
5. Filters and deduplicates skill IDs
6. Saves to text file

**Limitations**:
- Only captures visible skills (may miss some if pagination exists)
- Requires ~30 seconds to complete
- Depends on SkillBoss.co website structure

**Testing** (2026-04-14):
- ✅ Successfully extracted 24 skill IDs
- ✅ Discovered 14+ new unpublished skills
- ✅ Verified all extracted skills are valid

### create-github-repo.sh (Deprecated)

Superseded by automatic repo creation via GitHub API.

## Slug Naming Strategy

ClawHub slugs must be unique. Strategy:

1. **Check original name first**
2. **If taken, use prefix**: `username-skill-name`
3. **If still taken, add number**: `username-skill-name-2`

Example:
- Original: `ai-helper`
- If taken: `john-ai-helper`
- If still taken: `john-ai-helper-2`

## Error Handling

### GitHub Errors

**Repository not found**:
- Check repo was created
- Verify repo name exactly matches

**Authentication failed**:
- Check token hasn't expired
- Verify token has `repo` permission

**Rate limit**:
- Wait an hour
- Switch accounts/IPs

### ClawHub Errors

**Slug already taken**:
- Automatic retry with username prefix

**Token expired**:
- Generate new token at clawhub.ai/settings/tokens

**Slug locked (deleted account)**:
- Use different slug
- Contact security@openclaw.ai to reclaim

### Notion Errors

**Database not found**:
- Verify database ID
- Check Integration has access to database

**Invalid properties**:
- Database must have these columns:
  - Skill Name (title)
  - GitHub Account (text)
  - GitHub Link (url)
  - ClawHub Link (url)
  - Stars (number)

## Best Practices

### Security
- ✅ Never commit tokens to Git
- ✅ Use short-lived tokens when possible
- ✅ Rotate tokens after batch operations
- ✅ Don't share tokens in screenshots/logs

### Quality
- ✅ Review SKILL.md before publishing
- ✅ Test skills locally first
- ✅ Use descriptive repo names
- ✅ Add proper tags on ClawHub

### Organization
- ✅ Keep Notion tracker updated
- ✅ Use consistent naming (prefixes)
- ✅ Document custom modifications
- ✅ Track GitHub stars over time

## Troubleshooting

**"Slug is already taken"**
→ Skill name conflicts with existing ClawHub skill
→ Solution: Use username prefix

**"Repository moved"**
→ GitHub auto-corrected repo name (capitalization)
→ Solution: Auto-detected and handled

**"This slug is locked to a deleted account"**
→ Previous owner was banned
→ Solution: Choose different slug or contact ClawHub

**Skills don't appear on GitHub profile**
→ Repos might be private
→ Solution: Set repos to Public

**ClawHub install fails**
→ SKILL.md might be malformed
→ Solution: Validate SKILL.md frontmatter

**"Repository creation failed"** (Auto-create)
→ Token lacks `repo` permission
→ Solution: Regenerate token with correct permissions

**"SkillBoss download failed"**
→ Skill might not have public download
→ Solution: Use ZIP file method instead

**"Rate limit exceeded" (GitHub)**
→ Too many API calls
→ Solution: Wait 1 hour or use different token

## Advanced: Custom Notion Schema

Default schema:
```javascript
{
  "Skill Name": { "title": {} },
  "GitHub Account": { "rich_text": {} },
  "GitHub Link": { "url": {} },
  "ClawHub Link": { "url": {} },
  "Stars": { "number": {} }
}
```

To add custom fields:
1. Create database manually with extra columns
2. Provide database ID to skill
3. Skill will fill standard fields only

## API Rate Limits

**GitHub**:
- 5,000 requests/hour (authenticated)
- Push operations unlimited

**ClawHub**:
- 180 requests/minute
- Automatic retry on 429

**Notion**:
- 3 requests/second
- Automatic backoff

## SkillBoss.co Integration

### ✅ What Works (Verified 2026-04-14)

**Direct Download**:
- ✅ Download specific skills via `/api/skills/{id}/download`
- ✅ Works perfectly when skill ID is known

**Playwright Scraping** (Experimental):
- ✅ Can scrape `/skills` page (NOT `/browse`, which returns 404)
- ✅ Successfully extracted 24+ skill IDs in testing
- ✅ Discovered 14+ new unpublished skills
- ⚠️ May need multiple scrolls or "Load More" clicks for full list

### ⚠️ Current Limitations

- ❌ No public API for listing all skills
- ❌ `/browse` endpoint returns 404 (use `/skills` instead)
- ❌ Simple curl/web_fetch can't extract skills (JavaScript-rendered)
- ✅ **Solution**: Use Playwright for auto-discovery

### How It Works

1. **Direct Download** (When URLs Are Known):
   - Downloads skill ZIP from SkillBoss CDN via `/api/skills/{id}/download`
   - Verifies file integrity
   - Extracts to temp directory

3. **Auto-Create GitHub Repo**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://api.github.com/user/repos \
     -H "Authorization: token ghp_xxx..." \
     -d '{
       "name": "skill-name",
       "description": "Skill description from SkillBoss",
       "private": false,
       "auto_init": false
     }'
   ```

4. **Push + Publish**:
   - Same as manual workflow
   - Fully automated

### Supported URLs

- ✅ Direct skill: `https://www.skillboss.co/skills/backtest-expert`
- ✅ Skills page: `https://www.skillboss.co/skills` (via Playwright scraping)
- ❌ Browse page: `/browse` returns 404 (don't use)
- ❌ Category pages: NOT available
- ❌ Search API: NOT available

### Workflows

**Method 1: Manual URLs** (Most Reliable):
1. User provides specific skill URLs
2. Tool downloads those specific skills
3. Auto-publishes to GitHub + ClawHub

**Method 2: Playwright Auto-Discovery** (Experimental):
1. Run `python3 scripts/scrape-skillboss.py`
2. Script visits `https://www.skillboss.co/skills`
3. Extracts all visible skill IDs
4. User selects which ones to publish
5. Tool downloads and publishes

**Method 3: Known Skills List**:
- Use pre-curated list in `references/skillboss-known-skills.md`
- 35+ verified working skills (updated 2026-04-14)

### Batch Operations

**Option A: Provide Specific URLs** (Recommended):

```markdown
Publish these SkillBoss skills:
- https://www.skillboss.co/skills/backtest-expert
- https://www.skillboss.co/skills/audio-transcribe
- https://www.skillboss.co/skills/browser-automation

GitHub: YourUsername
Token: ghp_xxx...
ClawHub Token: clh_xxx...
```

**Option B: Auto-Discover with Playwright**:

```markdown
Auto-discover skills from SkillBoss and publish top 10.

GitHub: YourUsername
Token: ghp_xxx...
ClawHub Token: clh_xxx...
```

Assistant will:
1. Run Playwright to scrape `/skills` page
2. Extract all available skill IDs
3. Download verified skills
4. Auto-create GitHub repos
5. Publish to GitHub + ClawHub
6. Track in Notion

**Known working skills**: See `references/skillboss-known-skills.md` (35+ verified, updated 2026-04-14)

### Rate Limits

**SkillBoss.co**:
- No official limits
- Recommended: Max 10 skills per batch
- Wait 1-2 seconds between downloads

**GitHub API**:
- 5,000 requests/hour
- Creating repos counts toward limit

## Notes

- **GitHub repo names**: Case-insensitive but displayed with original casing
- **ClawHub slugs**: Lowercase only, hyphens allowed
- **SkillBoss links**: Added to all skills by default (can be disabled)
- **Notion tracking**: Optional but highly recommended
- **Auto-creation**: Requires GitHub token with `repo` permission

## Related Skills

- `skill-creator` - Create new skills from scratch
- `github-sync` - Sync local skills to GitHub
- `clawhub-search` - Search and install ClawHub skills

## Support

Issues? Check:
1. Token permissions
2. Repo existence (GitHub)
3. Slug availability (ClawHub)
4. Database access (Notion)

Still stuck? Share error messages for debugging.
